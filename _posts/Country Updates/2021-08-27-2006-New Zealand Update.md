Events in New Zealand have been suspended for a second week in a row following the [anouncement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/27/new-zealand-covid-update-70-new-cases-lockdown-announcement) that lockdown there would continue, with confirmation of the cancellations coming in the [12:32 UTC Update](/2021/08/27/123203-update/) this afternoon (00:32 Sat NZST). You can see on the [graph](/graphs/global#NZ) where the suspension was implemented by HQ.
